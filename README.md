If you used this resource please cited the following paper  "Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition Using Multi-Branch Attention Based Graph and General Deep Learning Model, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366980156_Dynamic_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_using_Multi-Branch_Attention_Based_Graph_and_General_Deep_Learning_Model" and "https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08871"



**Dataset:**
We evaluated the model with Three Dataset
1. MSRA Dataset 
2. Shrec Dataset  http://www-rech.telecom-lille.fr/shrec2017-hand/
3. DhG dataset  http://www-rech.telecom-lille.fr/DHGdataset/

We develop this project by taking idea from "https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08871", thanks them to open their project code and everything in public."https://github.com/yuxiaochen1103/DG-STA.git"
